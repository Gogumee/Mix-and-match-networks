# Object recoloring

This project is to do many-to-many mapping on color dataset.

# Dependences 
- Python2.7, NumPy, SciPy, NVIDIA GPU
- **Tensorflow:** the version should be more 1.0(https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- **Dataset:** Domain-specific color name datase(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xUU8B8vC3rxsA8eAOlyEs3ZyB5fgC0il/view), which is collected by [Luyu](https://yulu0724.github.io/) and compressed into tfrecords.  

# Installation 
- Install tensorflow
- Opencv 
# Instructions
- Cloning the repository
```bash
$ git clone  https://github.com/yaxingwang/Mix-and-match-networks.git
$ cd Mix-and-match-networks/color/
```
### Downloading the dataset
```bash
$ mkdir data 
```
Unzipping the downloaded color data and moving contained two folders('train' and 'test') into  'data'


    
- Download [pretrain models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KYzR-NEwKT1582USX31samfZ3JoJ5ija)

    Uncompressing downloaded folder to current folder, then you have new folder 'transfer_model'  which contains two folders: 'conditional', 'unconditional', each of which has four folders: 'imagenet', 'places', 'celebA', 'bedroom'

- Download dataset or use your dataset.

    I have shown one example and you could make it with same same form.

- Run 'python transfer_gan.py'

   Runing code with default setting. The pretrained model can be seleted by changing the parameter 'TARGET_DOMAIN'
 
- Conditional GAN 
  If you are interested in using conditional model, just setting parameter 'ACGAN = True'
# Results 
Using pretrained models not only get high performance, but fastly attach convergence. In following figure, we show conditional and unconditional settings.
